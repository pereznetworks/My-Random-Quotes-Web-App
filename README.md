# My Random Quotes

  - originally built as part of TeamTreehouse Tech Degree, Full Stack JavaScript, Unit 1.

#### **[Online version of My Random Quotes](https://pereznetworks.github.io/My-Random-Quotes-Web-App)**

## **NEW**

- Formating and Spacing for Mobile Devices

  - increased usable space of .container div
  - increased font size for large screens
  - trying to use containers more efficiently
  - tweaked some text formating also  
  - new font color

## **Wish list**

- use better font styling 

- add Accessibility features

- add multi-language support

- Standard UI Flat Icons

  - I am considering added flat icons for standard UI
    - like loading another qoute.
  - for now I have replaced the old "load another qoute" button with a special char instead
 - there are many but I would like to use flat ui icons that are standards based and open source

#### **[Check out one option I am considering : CoreUI.io/icons on GitHub](https://github.com/coreui/coreui-icons)**

## Beautiful Simplicity

  - The "My Random Quotes" Web App is simple.
    - It's just css styling, javascript and some json.


  - Provides a beautiful, simple user experience.


  - The challenge will be to maintain this simplicity as more features and functionality are added.

## Future Release Plans

### Obviously, I will want to add more quotes, lots and lots of quotes.

### I plan to release various versions:
  - a javascript-free version
  - a bootstrap version
  - a version that uses python
  - a universal mobile app version, maybe react native
  - a version made entirely using Xcode
  - a version made entirely using Android Studio

### I will be adding the following features:
  - play music with quote
  - display images and/or play video with quote
  - different images/video/music for each different quote
  - give the user the ability to add more Quotes
  - give the user the ability to save and launch their own 'my random quotes'
