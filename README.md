## Standard UI Flat Icons

  - I finally added a flat icon for loading another qoute. I am using a free CDN.

## Beautiful Simplicity

  - The "My Random Quotes" Web App is simple.
    - It's just css styling, javascript and some json.


  - Provides a beautiful, simple user experience.


  - The challenge will be to maintain this simplicity as more features and functionality are added.

## Future Release Plans

### Obviously, I will want to add more quotes, lots and lots of quotes.

### I plan to release various versions:
  - a javascript-free version
  - a bootstrap version
  - a version that uses python
  - a universal mobile app version, maybe react native
  - a version made entirely using Xcode
  - a version made entirely using Android Studio

### I will be adding the following features:
  - play music with quote
  - display images and/or play video with quote
  - different images/video/music for each different quote
  - give the user the ability to add more Quotes
  - give the user the ability to save and launch their own 'my random quotes'
