# TechDegree Project 1  - My Random Quotes

  - this is Project 1, part of TeamTreehouse, Tech Degree, Full Stack JavaScript, Unit 1.

## Beautiful Simplicity

  - The "My Random Quotes" Web App is simple.
    - It's just css styling and some javascript. But in this simplicity is the beauty.


  - Among my favorite things in life, and in technology, are those that are simple, beautiful yet powerful.


  - I am proud to say, that is one those web apps that provide users with a beautiful, simple user experience.

## Future Plans

### Obviously, I will want to add more quotes, lots and lots of quotes.

### Planned releases
  - a javascript-free version
  - a bootstrap version
  - a version that uses python
  - a universal mobile app version, maybe react native
  - a version made entirely using Xcode
  - a version made entirely using Android Studio

### Planned feature additions
  - add music to quote displayed
  - add images and/or video to quote being displayed
  - different images/video/music for each different quote
  - give the user the ability to add more Quotes
  - give the user the ability to save and launch their own random quotes web app
